# Opero
Job amalgamator written in HTML, CSS and PHP. Also relies on SQL queries.

Opero is Latin for 'I work', and was built during my senior year of college. I've since coded a few more websites, and have learned to 
make things easier on myself by implementing templates and functionality built on open soure libraries rather than build the whole thing from scratch.

The basic point of this website is to draw from as many APIs as possible to retrieve data about available jobs given some keywords and a location.

Each member builds a set of jobs that they can then store in their database and add to/subtract from as need be. 

At present, there is only one API being used, as I could only find one publicly available job API out there. 

I haven't tinkered with this code in years, but it was a fun project that turned out fairy well. It'd be worthwhile to see what other 
job APIs are out there now and make the code more robust as well as refine the front end some.
